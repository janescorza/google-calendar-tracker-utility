# Calendar Tracker App

Calendar Tracker App is a utility I designed to simplify the creation and management of events on your calendar for time tracking. This app is built using React Native and Expo, and it integrates with Google Calendar to provide seamless event tracking.

## Features

- **Effortless Event Creation**: Easily create events on any of your calendar.
- **Event Management**: View, edit, and delete events directly within the app.
- **Base Events**: Allow the creation of base events that allow for easy and quick instance creation.
- **Beautiful Dark Theme:** Enjoy a customizable dark theme for an enhanced user experience.
- **Offline Support**: Create and manage events even when offline. Changes will sync when the device is back online.
- **Stay Informed (Planned):** Receive timely notifications for upcoming events (configurability coming soon).

## Useful commands for development

Run `eas build --profile development --platform android` to build a development version if changes are made to native code.
Start the development server with `npx expo start --dev-client`.
